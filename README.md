## Generative Algorithms Repository

---
This repository contains Python implementations of generative algorithms, showcasing mathematical and computational concepts in computer graphics and visual art. The following examples demonstrate the beauty and complexity that can be achieved through Lindenmayer Systems, the Mandelbrot Set, and a Wallpaper Algorithm.


### Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems)
<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center; align-items: center; height: 100px; width: 70%;">
L-systems, a mathematical formalism used to model the growth processes of biological organisms. 
The provided Python code utilizes the Turtle graphics library to visualize the evolution of L-systems, creating intricate and self-replicating patterns.

### Mandelbrot Set
<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center; align-items: center; height: 100px; width: 70%;">
Mandelbrot Set, a famous fractal that reveals stunning patterns as complex numbers are iteratively computed. The Python code generates a visual representation of the Mandelbrot Set, allowing you to explore the infinite complexity within its boundaries.

### Wallpaper Algorithm

<div style="flex: 1;">
  
The cool thing about this algorithm is that when we modify the side of the square, we get a totally different pattern.
The wallpaper algorithm implemented in two colors and states. 
One is grayscale static plot that you can play with manually. 
Another one is colorful version of it with loop over the value of side that make it fully animated.

### Tower of Hanoi 

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. It was inspired by a legend. 
    The assignment was to transfer all disks from one of the three pegs to another.
    The rules specify, that you can only move one disk at a time and the disks on each peg must be stacked so that smaller disks are always on top of the larger one
