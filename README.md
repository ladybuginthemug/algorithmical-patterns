## Generative Algorithms Repository

So in this repository, I'm nerding out with Python and generative algorithms to make cool visuals and artsy computer graphics. ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

### Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems)

Itâ€™s 1968, and a Hungarian biologist named Aristid Lindenmayer is out here not just studying plants, but writing rules for how they grow. 
He comes up with something called L-systems, which are basically little instruction sets that simulate how plants develop over time. 
Think: one cell becomes two, two become four, and suddenly boom  ferns, flowers, and fractals.

### Mandelbrot Set
Discovered in 1980 by mathematician legend Benoit Mandelbrot, the Mandelbrot Set is one of the most iconic fractals out there. 

Itâ€™s all based on iterating complex numbers (thatâ€™s numbers with real and imaginary parts), and then plotting whether those numbers escape to infinity or stay trapped in this weird, beautiful mathematical hug. Zoom in, and the pattern repeats. Zoom in more? Itâ€™s still repeating forever. 
You get spirals, lightning bolts, little baby Mandelbrots.

### Wallpaper Algorithm

The cool thing about this algorithm is that when you modify the side of the square, you get a totally different pattern.
The wallpaper algorithm implemented in two colors and states:

- One is grayscale static plot that you can play with manually. 
- Another one is colorful version of it with loop over the value of side that make it fully animated.

### Tower of Hanoi 

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. 
It was inspired by a legend that deep in a Hindu temple, young priests were tasked with moving 64 golden disks between three sacred pegs, following very strict rules. 
When they finish, legend says the world ends. No pressure. :)

The rules specify, that you can only move one disk at a time and the disks on each peg must be stacked so that smaller disks are always on top of the larger one

The minimum number of moves needed to solve it is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.
So for 3 disks? Just 7 moves. Easy.

But for 64 disks like in the legend? Thatâ€™s 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 moves.
