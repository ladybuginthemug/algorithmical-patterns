## Generative Algorithms Repository

---

This repository contains Python implementations of generative algorithms, showcasing mathematical and computational concepts in computer graphics and visual art. The following examples demonstrate the beauty and complexity that can be achieved through Lindenmayer Systems, the Mandelbrot Set, and a Wallpaper Algorithm.


### Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems)

L-systems, a mathematical formalism used to model the growth processes of biological organisms. The provided Python code utilizes the Turtle graphics library to visualize the evolution of L-systems, creating intricate and self-replicating patterns.
