## Generative Algorithms Repository


This repository contains Python implementations of generative algorithms, showcasing mathematical and computational concepts in computer graphics and visual art. The following examples demonstrate the beauty and complexity that can be achieved through Lindenmayer Systems, the Mandelbrot Set, and a Wallpaper Algorithm.


### Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems)
L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.
Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms[2] and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.

### Mandelbrot Set
A famous fractal that reveals stunning patterns as complex numbers are iteratively computed,  discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980.

### Wallpaper Algorithm

The cool thing about this algorithm is that when we modify the side of the square, we get a totally different pattern.
The wallpaper algorithm implemented in two colors and states:

- One is grayscale static plot that you can play with manually. 
- Another one is colorful version of it with loop over the value of side that make it fully animated.

### Tower of Hanoi 

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. It was inspired by a legend that tell of a Hindu temple where the puzzle was presented to a young priests. 
The assignment was to transfer all disks from one of the three pegs to another.
The rules specify, that you can only move one disk at a time and the disks on each peg must be stacked so that smaller disks are always on top of the larger one
